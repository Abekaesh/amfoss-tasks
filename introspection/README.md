# Introspection
**Why must we choose you?**\
In order for a club to grow stronger,consistency in the field of coding as well as creative thinking is necessary. It is one of the greatest asset 
of a club and I do strongly believe that. I guarantee that I will be a great asset for the club in that way.\
**What is your plan for the next 6 months?**\
I am planning to participate in GSoC, Hashcode, Codejam, KickStart and apply for summer internship in Google for the post Software Developer Intern. 
Ofcourse learning new topics and participating in various hackathons are also included.\
**How would you contribute back to the club?**\
The club can expect creative open source projects which leads to the overall development of the club.\
**Do you have any feedback on the selection process?**\
I don't feel any disappointment in the selection process as it evaluates a person's technical and communication skills. This selection process itself helps 
a person to analyse their mistakes and give a chance to self develop.
